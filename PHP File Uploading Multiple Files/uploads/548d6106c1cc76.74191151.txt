5 Scripts
Developing in JavaScript? The scripts tab lets you view, edit and debug JavaScript code extremely easily. The insight this feature gives you into JavaScript code is fundamental to front end development.

Need to speed up your website? The audits tab will run a full audit of any page and suggest ways to improve it. We take a brief look at an audit and some examples of audit suggestions.
